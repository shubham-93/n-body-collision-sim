# n-body-collision-sim
Simulation of particles of random masses, positions and velocities colliding elastically inside a 2D box.

Use Python classes and matplotlib to make real-time physics simulations. A universal problem in physics is about describing the motion of particles interacting with each other and the environment. These particles can have different properties, like velocity, which change upon interactions. This allows many physics problems to be modelled in an object-oriented framework: the properties become the attributes, and the interactions become the methods.
